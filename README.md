Reparameterized SGLMM (Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed Model): A Review

Frances Lin

## Description 

Review and replicate part of the results from a paper about a sparse, reparameterized SGLMM (Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed Model) that alleviates spatial confounding and speeds computation through dimension reduction: introduction, review (traditional SGLMM, automodel, RHS model), sparse SGLMM, simulation and application.
